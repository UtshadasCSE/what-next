# 🚀 My TypeScript ➜ Next.js Full-Stack Journey

Hi 👋 — I’m currently building my **full-stack developer skills** step by step.  
I started by learning **TypeScript** deeply and now I’m exploring **Next.js**, Prisma, MongoDB, and modern tools to build production-ready apps.

---

## ✅ Stage 1 — TypeScript ✔️

I focused on:

- Understanding **type annotations**, `interface`, `type`, `enum`.
- Practicing **type safety** for API data & React props.
- Writing **type-safe functions**, **generics**, and **utility types**.
- Using TypeScript in simple React + Node projects.

> **Status:** Completed — I’m now comfortable using TypeScript in all my projects.

## ⚡️ Stage 2 — Next.js Deep Dive 🚀

I’m currently **diving deep into Next.js** with TypeScript:

### 📌 What I’m learning:

- App Router & File-based Routing
- Server Components vs Client Components
- API Routes & Middlewares
- Dynamic Routing & Nested Layouts
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Connecting Prisma + MongoDB
- Authentication with **NextAuth.js**
- Building beautiful UIs with **shadcn/ui**
- Using **Axios** and **React Hot Toast** for smooth UX
- Deploying on **Vercel**

## 🔨 Projects I’m Building

I’m applying what I learn through real projects:

- ✅ **CRUD apps** with Prisma & MongoDB
- ✅ **Auth flows** (Google, GitHub, Facebook, Twitter)
- ✅ **User Dashboards**
- ✅ Modern, responsive UI components
- ✅ Real deployment with **Vercel + MongoDB Atlas**
